**IMPORTANT**:

Due to the discontinuance of the development of the discord.py library (Read [here](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1)), we will no longer be developing this bot. We will now work on migrating the entire bot to JS, i.e., using the discord.js library. There will be a new [repository](https://github.com/sach-12/pesu-bot-js) for it wherein you can help us contribute towards the migration.


**UPDATE**:

The PESU Python Bot is now offline forever. Migration to JavaScript is finished and this repository will now be read-only. The JS rewritten bot repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sach-12/pesu-bot-js)
